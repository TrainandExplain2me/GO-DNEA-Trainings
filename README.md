All trainings taken by and recommended to the GO DNEA team. Trainings are mostly taken from conferences and commercial trainings over the years. Have a request? Send a message or email to Sierra! SID is located within the GO DNEA page.

Branches on this page are seperated out by conference and cert. Conferences will have all available videos, course material, and exersizes that were provided. All certifications will have the training material assoicated. 

Certification study material on this page maybe out of date. These materials should NOT be used to study for certifications, and should only be used to expand your knowledge. Certifcation tests change very often. Study guides from 2024 wont contain everything a study guide from 2025 would. If you are looking to take and pass a certification test, please purchase the material directly from the provider.
